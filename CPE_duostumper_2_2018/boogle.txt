binary name:		boggle
repository name:	CPE_duostumper_$STUMPERNUMBER_$ACADEMICYEAR
repository rights:	ramassage-tek
language:			C
compilation:		via Makefile, including re, clean and fclean rules

• Your repository must contain the totality of your source files, but no useless files (binary, temp files, obj files,...).

• Error messages have to be written on the error output, and the program should then exit with the 84 error code (0 if there is no error).

The $STUMPERNUMBER is always on one digit: 1 , 2 , . . .

For this project, the only authorized functions are those of the standard libC.

Boggle is a game that is made up of a grid of arranged letters among ‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’.
The goal is to find words within this grid. In order to validate a word, the letters must be side to side to one another.

A letter cannot be used more than once in a word.

Your program must look for a word, entered on the standart input, within such a grid.
If found, the grid must be displayed with the word in capital letters; otherwise, an error message must be displayed.

Usage:		./boggle -g GRID [-s SIZE] [-w WORD]
-s SIZE defines the size of a side of the grid (def: 4)
-g GRID specifies a hard-coded grid (MANDATORY). If the grid does not contain the correct number of characters, you must display an error.
-w WORD force the word to be looked for.
