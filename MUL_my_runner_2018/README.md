# Runner
The runner is a infinite scroller with parallax effect, made during the first year of Epitech.

The goal was to work on the generation part of the world only with the use of **CSFML**.

*The project works with the use of make so only for Linux*


To compile the project you will have to install dependancies first:

Install **make**:

```
sudo apt-get install make
```

Install **gcc**:

```
sudo apt-get install gcc
```

Install **CSFML**:

```
sudo apt-get install libcsfml-dev libcsfml-doc
```

After all the installations you can *compile* with:
```
make re
```

Now just launch with this command and read the instruction to play:
```
./my_runner -h
```
