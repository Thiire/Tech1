# World
The World is a sandbox in which you can move and edit the world as you like, i'd recommand reading the help for all the differents actions.

The goal was to work on the generation part of the world only with the use of **CSFML**.

*The project works with the use of make so only for Linux*


To compile the project you will have to install dependancies first:

Install **make**:

```
sudo apt-get install make
```

Install **gcc**:

```
sudo apt-get install gcc
```

Install **CSFML**:

```
sudo apt-get install libcsfml-dev libcsfml-doc
```

After all the installations you can *compile* with:
```
make re
```

Now just launch with this command and read the instruction to play:
```
./my_world -h
```
