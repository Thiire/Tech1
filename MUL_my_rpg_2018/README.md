# RPG
RPG is a project made during EPitech First Year, it's goal is to make a game with quest and rpg system. We decided to make a remake of "*The binding of isaac*" with quest and shop option to move along different generated room.

The goal was to work on the generation part of the world only with the use of **Ncurses** and **CSFML**.

*The project works with the use of make so only for Linux*


To compile the project you will have to install dependancies first:

Install **make**:

```
sudo apt-get install make
```

Install **gcc**:

```
sudo apt-get install gcc
```

Install **CSFML**:

```
sudo apt-get install libcsfml-dev libcsfml-doc
```

Install **NCRUSES**:

```
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
```

After all the installations you can *compile* with:
```
make re
```

Now just launch and have fun with:
```
./my_rpg
```
